1. Implement a program that creates 8 new processes.
• Each process reads 200 Numbers from a text file (“Numbers.txt”) and write those numbers to the file “Output.txt”;
• At any time only one child should be able to read/write into the files (one process in each of the files);
• At the end, the father process should print the content of the file “Output.txt”.
