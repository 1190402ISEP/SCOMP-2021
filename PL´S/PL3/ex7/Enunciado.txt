7. Implement a solution that allows you to share an array of 10 integers between two processes not related
hierarchically, a writer and a reader.

•The writer must create a shared memory area, generate 10 random numbers between 1 and 20 and write
them in the shared memory.
• The reader should read the 10 values, calculate and print the average.
Note: the writer must be executed before the reader.
