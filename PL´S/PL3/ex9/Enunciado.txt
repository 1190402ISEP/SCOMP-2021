Implement a program to determine the biggest element of an array in a parallel/concurrent environment. The
parent process should:
• Create an array of 1000 integers, initializing it with random values between 0 and 1000;
• Create a shared memory area to store an array of 10 integers, each containing the local maximum of 100 values;
• Create 10 new processes;
• Wait until the 10 child processes finish the search for the local maximum;
• Determine the global maximum;
• Eliminate the shared memory area.
Each child process should:
• Calculate the largest element in the 100 positions;
• Write the value found in the position corresponding to the order number (0-9) in the array of local maximum.
