3. Implement a solution that tests the speed of two transfer methods between two processes – pipes and shared
memory.
• Start by filling an array of 100 000 structures with an integer and the “ISEP – SCOMP 2020” string.
• Start a timer and copy that array between the two processes using shared memory. Start a timer and use
a pipe to transfer the same amount of data between processes.
